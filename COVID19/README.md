## COVID-19 Percolation Model

This repository contains a Python script for simulating the spread of the COVID-19 virus using percolation theory. The model uses a grid-based approach to simulate infection spread, recovery, death rates, and vaccination effects over time. The percolation model can be also be used for wildfires simulation. 

## Features
- Grid creation for simulation space.
- Simulation of infection spread with adjustable parameters.
- Visualization of the infection spread over time.
- Tracking and plotting of SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
Run `COVID19_Percolation.py` to start the simulation. Modify parameters within the script to adjust the model's behavior.

- This model is a simple representation and should not be used for scientific or medical purposes.
- Developed as an educational tool for understanding the dynamics of infectious disease spread.
