# Wildfire Percolation Simulation

This project contains a Python script for simulating the spread of wildfires using a basic percolation model. It is a very basic model used to provide an idea of the options related.

## Description
The script uses wildfire data to initialize a grid-based simulation environment. It then applies a simple percolation process to model the potential spread of wildfires.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SQLite3

### Installing
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install the required packages using `pip install numpy matplotlib`.

### Executing the program
